Diffbot Product Creator
=================

Create products in the WordPress database using just a URL. This plugin uses the Diffbot API to query product data and return key fields back to be saved.

Define `DIFFBOT_API_KEY` in your wp-config.php and you're ready to go! 

```php
define( 'DIFFBOT_API_KEY', 'API_KEY_GOES_HERE' );
```
